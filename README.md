I am learning Python, so I decided it would be a good practice to try to solve the challenges in AoC, I previously attempted in 2021 and 2022 but did not complete it. Lets try make it different this year.

Unfortunatelly my code isn't always original, while I am learning it is difficult to come with my own 100% OG ideas. However I always try to understand what I am doing in said moment, althought it does not make it easier for me.
